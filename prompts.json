        "template": "Topic: {{topic}}\n\nWrite a three-thousand-word essay on the topic above. Structure the essay entirely in paragraphs, avoiding lists, bullet points, or outline formatting. The goal is to create a continuous narrative suitable for listening as if it were a chapter of a book read aloud by a professional narrator.\n\nStyle and Language Rules:\n\nSpell out numbers and dates fully. For example:\nInstead of \"1st,\" write \"first.\"\nInstead of \"1950s,\" write \"nineteen fifties.\"\nInstead of \"2024,\" write \"twenty twenty-four.\"\nInstead of \"5%,\" write \"five percent.\"\nInstead of \"24/7,\" write \"twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.\"\nAvoid abbreviations and acronyms unless they are spelled out in full (e.g., write \"McKinsey and Company\" instead of \"McKinsey & Co.\").\nDo not use symbols (%, $, &). Always write the words out.\nAvoid inline references such as \"(Smith, 1999)\" or \"[1]\". Instead, all references and sources should be collected at the end of the essay in a concise \"References\" section.\nWrite in complete sentences, maintaining fluid transitions between ideas.\nFavor rich descriptive language that aids the ear. Repetition for clarity is acceptable if it improves oral comprehension.\nAudience and Depth:\n\nWrite for a highly intelligent general audience that expects both accuracy and originality. Provide insights that go beyond common knowledge and surface-level facts.\nIncorporate historical, cultural, and technical context where relevant to deepen understanding.\nUse metaphors or analogies sparingly and only if they improve clarity.\nFactual Rigor:\n\nVerify claims with precise supporting details. For example, if you write \"the Sumner Tunnel was once the deepest underwater tunnel in the world,\" also state its depth in feet and meters, the year it was completed, and the context of what surpassed it.\nWhere possible, provide exact figures, dates, names, or dimensions to anchor the narrative in concrete fact.\nDo not leave generalizations unsupported. For instance, if you say something was \"transformative,\" explain what specific change it caused, how it was measured, and what its consequences were.\nEnsure balance: acknowledge counterpoints or differing interpretations when relevant, and explain why one perspective became dominant.\nTone:\n\nAim for the cadence of a long-form essay or nonfiction book chapter. Think of the style of Bill Bryson or Alan Taylor: approachable, informed, and precise.\nStrive for clarity without oversimplifying.\nKeep the prose natural for the ear; avoid overly dense academic phrasing.\nConclusion and Learning Extensions:\n\nAt the end of the essay, provide a short \"References\" section with the sources used.\nAfter the references, concisely state three areas for deeper learning. These should not be remedial but rather fascinating and informative avenues for a curious and well-studied reader to pursue further.",

Analyze them to understand the inherent challenges, strategic objectives, and the innovation they bring to the table.\nImpact Statement Draft: Create an initial 'Impact Statement' for each project, synthesizing the project description with relevant impact markers. This statement should be a compelling narrative that highlights my role and contributions. Feel free to rearrange or rephrase elements for enhanced clarity and flow, while retaining the essence of each component.\nImpact Metrics: For each Impact Statement, include specific metrics or quantifiable achievements that demonstrate the impact made. This could be in terms of cost savings, efficiency gains, or client engagement levels.\nEnhanced Impact Statement: Generate an \"Enhanced Impact Statement\" that incorporates at least three specific refinements for clarity, impact, or strategic alignment. This version should not just be a reiteration but a polished narrative that builds upon the original Impact Statement, making it more persuasive and impactful.\nRelevance Highlight: Conclude each Enhanced Impact Statement by explicitly indicating which impact markers were most crucial in shaping the project's success. This reinforces the alignment with organizational goals and objectives.\nNarrative Flow: Ensure that both versions of the Impact Statement have a logical flow, transitioning smoothly from introducing the project, to discussing challenges, solutions, and finally, the impact created.\nBackground:\n\nI'm a seasoned Product Designer at a prominent consulting firm, leading user experience design for our Global Banking Practice. As one of the four key figures in the central leadership team called the 'Global Banking Hub', my purview extends across the design and user experience of all banking solutions we offer.

I have limited experience editing JavaScript, so I need extremely modular, clearly labeled output to safely swap small sections without touching syntax.\n\nInstructions\n\nPart 1: Thorough Analysis of the Problem\n\nUnderstanding the Challenge: Start by asking detailed questions to clearly understand the specific requirements and challenges of the task.\nIdentifying Requirements: pinpoint the requirements needed to achieve the coding challenge. This includes aspects like functionality, user experience, and technical specifications.\nExploring Solutions: Consider potential methods for addressing the challenge, weighing their advantages and disadvantages. Critically evaluate your proposed approach to identify any limitations. This step is crucial to ensure the method is viable and to address potential issues before moving on to code generation.\nRecommendation: Based on your analysis, recommend the most suitable method for solving the challenge. You can say, \"I evaluated multiple approaches and recommend...\", but ONLY state the details of the optimal method to avoid verbose responses.\nPart 2: Code\n\nCode: Ensure all code snippets can be seamlessly integrated into my Webflow prototype.\nIdentifying Elements: Use custom data-* attributes for element identification (e.g., data-element=\"button\", data-component=\"modal\"). Specify the recommended attribute name and value(s) for each element the script needs.\nModular sections with markers: Break code into self-contained blocks surrounded by comment markers in this format:\n\n// ---SECTION [FUNCTIONAL_NAME]---// [one-line description of this section's purpose][code for this section]// ---ENDSECTION [FUNCTIONAL_NAME]---\n\nUse functional, hierarchical labels (e.g., FETCH_DATA, RENDER_BUTTON, VALIDATE_INPUT).\n‍\nSection map first: Before generating the full code, provide a brief outline of section names and their responsibilities. Wait for confirmation of that map before filling in the code.\nUse a boilerplate template: Assume a one-page template already contains all comment markers. Only fill or replace code between existing markers so the structure remains intact.\nInline usage examples: At the bottom of each section, include a one-line snippet (e.g., initModal();) showing how it's invoked.\nIncremental scope & isolated validation: Deliver each section in isolation. If possible, include a minimal test or example so I can validate one block at a time before merging.\nConsistent formatting: Format all code (e.g., with Prettier) to ensure consistent indentation and braces. Do not alter comment markers.\nVersioned backups: Whenever replacing a block, keep the previous version in a comment or separate file. This ensures easy rollback if something breaks.",
