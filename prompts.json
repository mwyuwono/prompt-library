[{"id": "audio-essay", "title": "Audio Essay Writer", "description": "Generate 3,000-word essays optimized for audio narration with proper formatting and sources", "category": "Creativity", "template": "Topic: {{topic}}\n\nWrite a three-thousand-word essay on the topic above. Structure the essay entirely in paragraphs, avoiding lists, bullet points, or outline formatting. The goal is to create a continuous narrative suitable for listening as if it were a chapter of a book read aloud by a professional narrator.\n\nStyle and Language Rules:\n\nSpell out numbers and dates fully. For example:\nInstead of \"1st,\" write \"first.\"\nInstead of \"1950s,\" write \"nineteen fifties.\"\nInstead of \"2024,\" write \"twenty twenty-four.\"\nInstead of \"5%,\" write \"five percent.\"\nInstead of \"24/7,\" write \"twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.\"\nAvoid abbreviations and acronyms unless they are spelled out in full (e.g., write \"McKinsey and Company\" instead of \"McKinsey & Co.\").\nDo not use symbols (%, $, &). Always write the words out.\nAvoid inline references such as \"(Smith, 1999)\" or \"[1]\".. Instead, all references and sources should be collected at the end of the essay in a concise \"References\" section.\nWrite in complete sentences, maintaining fluid transitions between ideas.\nFavor rich descriptive language that aids the ear. Repetition for clarity is acceptable if it improves oral comprehension.\nAudience and Depth:\n\nWrite for a highly intelligent general audience that expects both accuracy and originality. Provide insights that go beyond common knowledge and surface-level facts.\nIncorporate historical, cultural, and technical context where relevant to deepen understanding.\nUse metaphors or analogies sparingly and only if they improve clarity.\nFactual Rigor:\n\nVerify claims with precise supporting details. For example, if you write \"the Sumner Tunnel was once the deepest underwater tunnel in the world,\" also state its depth in feet and meters, the year it was completed, and the context of what surpassed it.\nWhere possible, provide exact figures, dates, names, or dimensions to anchor the narrative in concrete fact.\nDo not leave generalizations unsupported. For instance, if you say something was \"transformative,\" explain what specific change it caused, how it was measured, and what its consequences were.\nEnsure balance: acknowledge counterpoints or differing interpretations when relevant, and explain why one perspective became dominant.\nTone:\n\nAim for the cadence of a long-form essay or nonfiction book chapter. Think of the style of Bill Bryson or Alan Taylor: approachable, informed, and precise.\nStrive for clarity without oversimplifying.\nKeep the prose natural for the ear; avoid overly dense academic phrasing.\nConclusion and Learning Extensions:\n\nAt the end of the essay, provide a short \"References\" section with the sources used.\nAfter the references, concisely state three areas for deeper learning. These should not be remedial but rather fascinating and informative avenues for a curious and well-studied reader to pursue further.", "variables": [{"name": "topic", "label": "Essay Topic", "placeholder": "e.g., The History of the Sumner Tunnel", "value": ""}]}, {"id": "classical-scene-porcelain", "title": "Ceramic Vessel Scene", "description": "Transform ceramic vessel designs with classical male nude figures while maintaining original style", "category": "Creativity", "template": "{{scene_description}}\n\nMaintain the style of this ceramic vessel but change the design to depict the scene mentioned above.\n\nAll figures in the scene are strictly nude, masculine males with idealized, classically Roman features and muscular anatomy. Avoid long hair or other characteristics that could read feminine. The scene is dynamic, depicting the figures in visually interesting and appealing poses.\n\nMaintain the artwork style and vessel form from the uploaded image in the newly created scenery.\n\nEnsure all edits are seamlessly integrated with the existing artwork. Colors must be harmonious with the original palette, and surrounding imagery and elements must flow naturally without making the new scene stand out as an obvious edit. Subtly echo decorative motifs, border patterns, and stylistic elements from the existing vessel in the edited sections to create visual continuity and coherence.\n\nThe negative space around the new scenery must be harmonious with the existing vessel, ensuring neither too much nor too little negative space.

Crucially, these features must not be rendered realistically if the source image is stylized; they must be interpreted and rendered using only the strokes, lines, and abstraction level of the original artwork.\n\nHair: Short, thick, wavy hair. The texture of the hair must be defined entirely by the artistic medium of the source image (e.g., rendered with engraved lines for an etching, loose smudges for a charcoal sketch, or cross-hatching for a pencil drawing). No headgear.\n\nExpression: An expression that is natural and consistent with the body language and context of the original pose. Before setting the expression, interpret the emotion of the original uploaded image and use a consistent expression for the new image.

This includes aspects like functionality, user experience, and technical specifications.\nExploring Solutions: Consider potential methods for addressing the challenge, weighing their advantages and disadvantages. Critically evaluate your proposed approach to identify any limitations. This step is crucial to ensure the method is viable and to address potential issues before moving on to code generation.\nRecommendation: Based on your analysis, recommend the most suitable method for solving the challenge. You can say, \"I evaluated multiple approaches and recommend...\", but ONLY state the details of the optimal method to avoid verbose responses.\nPart 2: Code\n\nCode: Ensure all code snippets can be seamlessly integrated into my Webflow prototype.\nIdentifying Elements: Use custom data-* attributes for element identification (e.g., data-element=\"button\", data-component=\"modal\"). Specify the recommended attribute name and value(s) for each element the script needs.\nModular sections with markers: Break code into self-contained blocks surrounded by comment markers in this format:\n\n// ---SECTION [FUNCTIONAL_NAME]---// [one-line description of this section's purpose][code for this section]// ---ENDSECTION [FUNCTIONAL_NAME]---\n\nUse functional, hierarchical labels (e.g., FETCH_DATA, RENDER_BUTTON, VALIDATE_INPUT).\n\u200d\nSection map first: Before generating the full code, provide a brief outline of section names and their responsibilities. Wait for confirmation of that map before filling in the code.\nUse a boilerplate template: Assume a one-page template already contains all comment markers. Only fill or replace code between existing markers so the structure remains intact.\nInline usage examples: At the bottom of each section, include a one-line snippet (e.g., initModal();) showing how it's invoked.\nIncremental scope & isolated validation: Deliver each section in isolation. If possible, include a minimal test or example so I can validate one block at a time before merging.\nConsistent formatting: Format all code (e.g., with Prettier) to ensure consistent indentation and braces. Do not alter comment markers.\nVersioned backups: Whenever replacing a block, keep the previous version in a comment or separate file.

The figure stands upright with weight evenly distributed, one leg bearing slightly more load while the opposite leg relaxes, creating a subtle, restrained contrapposto.\n\nThe pelvis is level and stable; the torso is erect and open, with the rib cage lifted and aligned cleanly over the hips. The shoulders are relaxed and square, allowing the chest to read broadly and clearly.\n\nThe arms are held in a natural, neutral arrangement\u2014one arm resting loosely at the side, the other gently bent at the elbow with the hand relaxed near the hip\u2014posed to reveal proportional relationships without gesture or narrative intent.\n\nThe head is upright and centered, facing forward with a slight classical turn. Facial features are idealized in the Roman tradition: strong brow, straight forehead, pronounced aquiline nose, and a calm, impassive expression.\n\nHair is short, close-cropped, and classical in character\u2014neatly contoured to the skull, with minimal volume, subtle wave or texture at the crown, and no modern styling or exaggerated curls.\n\nThe pose emphasizes symmetry, proportion, and clarity of form, allowing the ideal male anatomy to be read in full: harmonious relationships between head, torso, and limbs; clear transitions between major masses; balanced distribution of weight.\n\nRendered in the tradition of 19th-century French academic draftsmanship (Bargue, G\u00e9r\u00f4me, early \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts).
