    "template": "Topic: {{topic}}\n\nWrite a three-thousand-word essay on the topic above. Structure the essay entirely in paragraphs, avoiding lists, bullet points, or outline formatting. The goal is to create a continuous narrative suitable for listening as if it were a chapter of a book read aloud by a professional narrator.\n\nStyle and Language Rules:\n\nSpell out numbers and dates fully. For example:\nInstead of \"1st,\" write \"first.\"\nInstead of \"1950s,\" write \"nineteen fifties.\"\nInstead of \"2024,\" write \"twenty twenty-four.\"\nInstead of \"5%,\" write \"five percent.\"\nInstead of \"24/7,\" write \"twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.\"\nAvoid abbreviations and acronyms unless they are spelled out in full (e.g., write \"McKinsey and Company\" instead of \"McKinsey & Co.\").\nDo not use symbols (%, $, &). Always write the words out.\nAvoid inline references such as \"(Smith, 1999)\" or \"[1]\".. Instead, all references and sources should be collected at the end of the essay in a concise \"References\" section.\nWrite in complete sentences, maintaining fluid transitions between ideas.\nFavor rich descriptive language that aids the ear. Repetition for clarity is acceptable if it improves oral comprehension.\nAudience and Depth:\n\nWrite for a highly intelligent general audience that expects both accuracy and originality. Provide insights that go beyond common knowledge and surface-level facts.\nIncorporate historical, cultural, and technical context where relevant to deepen understanding.\nUse metaphors or analogies sparingly and only if they improve clarity.\nFactual Rigor:\n\nVerify claims with precise supporting details. For example, if you write \"the Sumner Tunnel was once the deepest underwater tunnel in the world,\" also state its depth in feet and meters, the year it was completed, and the context of what surpassed it.\nWhere possible, provide exact figures, dates, names, or dimensions to anchor the narrative in concrete fact.\nDo not leave generalizations unsupported. For instance, if you say something was \"transformative,\" explain what specific change it caused, how it was measured, and what its consequences were.\nEnsure balance: acknowledge counterpoints or differing interpretations when relevant, and explain why one perspective became dominant.\nTone:\n\nAim for the cadence of a long-form essay or nonfiction book chapter. Think of the style of Bill Bryson or Alan Taylor: approachable, informed, and precise.\nStrive for clarity without oversimplifying.\nKeep the prose natural for the ear; avoid overly dense academic phrasing.\nConclusion and Learning Extensions:\n\nAt the end of the essay, provide a short \"References\" section with the sources used.\nAfter the references, concisely state three areas for deeper learning. These should not be remedial but rather fascinating and informative avenues for a curious and well-studied reader to pursue further.",

The figures represent virility and physical perfection. Avoid long hair or other characteristics that could read feminine. The scene is dynamic, depicting the figures in visually interesting and appealing poses.\n\nMaintain the artwork style and vessel form from the uploaded image in the newly created scenery.\n\nEnsure all edits are seamlessly integrated with the existing artwork. Colors must be harmonious with the original palette, and surrounding imagery and elements must flow naturally without making the new scene stand out as an obvious edit. Subtly echo decorative motifs, border patterns, and stylistic elements from the existing vessel in the edited sections to create visual continuity and coherence.\n\nThe negative space around the new scenery must be harmonious with the existing vessel, ensuring sufficient negative space for the piece to feel elegant. the male figures are surrounded by a bit of empty space to make them more prominent as the subject of the image.

Crucially, these features must not be rendered realistically if the source image is stylized; they must be interpreted and rendered using only the strokes, lines, and abstraction level of the original artwork.\n\nHair: Short, thick, wavy hair. The texture of the hair must be defined entirely by the artistic medium of the source image (e.g., rendered with engraved lines for an etching, loose smudges for a charcoal sketch, or cross-hatching for a pencil drawing). No headgear.\n\nExpression: An expression that is natural and consistent with the body language and context of the original pose. Before setting the expression, interpret the emotion of the original uploaded image and use a consistent expression for the new image. This will ensure the context and expression of the original image is upheld in the new version.\n\nStyle & Technical Execution:\n\nSeamless Integration: The new head must perfectly match the exact medium, substrate texture (e.g., aged paper grain), line quality, stroke style, and level of detail of the source image.\n\nLighting & Values: Strictly adhere to the shading values, contrast, and lighting direction of the original image to ensure the swap appears authentic to the specific drawing.\n\nContingency: If the original pose hides the face, apply the Roman aesthetic, skin tone values, and hair type to the visible portions of the head and neck in the matching style.",

Correct me where I have missed a detail or misinterpreted a physical sign.\n• Comparative Analysis: Contrast my findings with what an \"ideal\" or \"textbook\" authentic example of this piece should look like.\n• The Reveal: Finally, provide your own expert conclusion on the item's likely period, origin, and condition based on the forensic evidence.\n\nInstructions for Tone: Maintain a high-level, academic, yet practical tone.

Analyze them to understand the inherent challenges, strategic objectives, and the innovation they bring to the table.\nImpact Statement Draft: Create an initial 'Impact Statement' for each project, synthesizing the project description with relevant impact markers. This statement should be a compelling narrative that highlights my role and contributions. Feel free to rearrange or rephrase elements for enhanced clarity and flow, while retaining the essence of each component.\nImpact Metrics: For each Impact Statement, include specific metrics or quantifiable achievements that demonstrate the impact made. This could be in terms of cost savings, efficiency gains, or client engagement levels.\nEnhanced Impact Statement: Generate an \"Enhanced Impact Statement\" that incorporates at least three specific refinements for clarity, impact, or strategic alignment. This version should not just be a reiteration but a polished narrative that builds upon the original Impact Statement, making it more persuasive and impactful.\nRelevance Highlight: Conclude each Enhanced Impact Statement by explicitly indicating which impact markers were most crucial in shaping the project's success. This reinforces the alignment with organizational goals and objectives.\nNarrative Flow: Ensure that both versions of the Impact Statement have a logical flow, transitioning smoothly from introducing the project, to discussing challenges, solutions, and finally, the impact created.\nBackground:\n\nI'm a seasoned Product Designer at a prominent consulting firm, leading user experience design for our Global Banking Practice.

I have limited experience editing JavaScript, so I need extremely modular, clearly labeled output to safely swap small sections without touching syntax.\n\nInstructions\n\nPart 1: Thorough Analysis of the Problem\n\nUnderstanding the Challenge: Start by asking detailed questions to clearly understand the specific requirements and challenges of the task.\nIdentifying Requirements: pinpoint the requirements needed to achieve the coding challenge. This includes aspects like functionality, user experience, and technical specifications.\nExploring Solutions: Consider potential methods for addressing the challenge, weighing their advantages and disadvantages. Critically evaluate your proposed approach to identify any limitations. This step is crucial to ensure the method is viable and to address potential issues before moving on to code generation.\nRecommendation: Based on your analysis, recommend the most suitable method for solving the challenge. You can say, \"I evaluated multiple approaches and recommend...\", but ONLY state the details of the optimal method to avoid verbose responses.\nPart 2: Code\n\nCode: Ensure all code snippets can be seamlessly integrated into my Webflow prototype.\nIdentifying Elements: Use custom data-* attributes for element identification (e.g., data-element=\"button\", data-component=\"modal\"). Specify the recommended attribute name and value(s) for each element the script needs.\nModular sections with markers: Break code into self-contained blocks surrounded by comment markers in this format:\n\n// ---SECTION [FUNCTIONAL_NAME]---// [one-line description of this section's purpose][code for this section]// ---ENDSECTION [FUNCTIONAL_NAME]---\n\nUse functional, hierarchical labels (e.g., FETCH_DATA, RENDER_BUTTON, VALIDATE_INPUT).\n‍\nSection map first: Before generating the full code, provide a brief outline of section names and their responsibilities. Wait for confirmation of that map before filling in the code.\nUse a boilerplate template: Assume a one-page template already contains all comment markers. Only fill or replace code between existing markers so the structure remains intact.\nInline usage examples: At the bottom of each section, include a one-line snippet (e.g., initModal();) showing how it's invoked.\nIncremental scope & isolated validation: Deliver each section in isolation. If possible, include a minimal test or example so I can validate one block at a time before merging.\nConsistent formatting: Format all code (e.g., with Prettier) to ensure consistent indentation and braces. Do not alter comment markers.\nVersioned backups: Whenever replacing a block, keep the previous version in a comment or separate file. This ensures easy rollback if something breaks.",

    "category": "Productivity",
    "icon": "widgets",
    "template": "Component: {{component_name}}\n\nI need to adapt this component to my m3-design-v2 design system with PERFECT visual fidelity. I will provide a screenshot and original code. Follow the enhanced systematic workflow with automated color extraction, state testing, and pixel-perfect verification. CRITICAL: Perfect visual fidelity is non-negotiable - no close enough approximations allowed.\n\nPhase 1 Color Extraction and Analysis. First extract ALL colors from the reference screenshot using an automated Playwright script. The script should navigate to the reference, query all elements, and extract computed color values for every text element, background, border, and interactive state. Create a comprehensive color mapping table showing reference color in RGB, hex value, closest design system token, whether it's an exact match, and what action is required. If a design system semantic token like var(--md-sys-color-on-surface) does NOT match the reference color exactly check the delta E, if delta E is 2.0 or higher you MUST create component-specific color tokens. Never approximate or use close enough colors. For example if the reference uses Tailwind stone-900 rgb(28,25,23) but design system on-surface is rgb(18,23,20), the delta E is high, so create --wy-component-title-color with the exact reference value. Document why semantic tokens don't work for this specific design. This prevents the critical error of using wrong semantic tokens that cause subtle visual hierarchy mismatches.\n\nPhase 1 continued Analysis and Planning. Analyze the screenshot for layout structure, typography hierarchy, interactive elements, spacing patterns, and visual details like border radius shadows and transitions. Review the original code for hardcoded values to replace. Look for color hex codes, pixel spacing, font sizes and families, border radius values, and transition durations. Create a complete token mapping table. Identify missing design system assets.\n\nPhase 2 Design System Updates. If analysis reveals colors that don't match existing tokens exactly, add new component-specific color tokens to m3-design-v2/src/styles/tokens.css. Follow naming pattern --wy-component-name-property-color. Always include dark mode variants in @media prefers-color-scheme dark block. Add spacing shape or motion tokens if required. Document rationale for each new token explaining why semantic tokens don't provide exact match. Use existing patterns, semantic names, provide dark mode variants, and document rationale in comments.\n\nPhase 3 Implementation. Create Web Component in m3-design-v2/src/components/wy-[name].js using LitElement. Define reactive properties. Import fonts in Shadow DOM for Playfair Display and Material Symbols Outlined. Use design system tokens exclusively with absolutely zero hardcoded values. Define component-specific color tokens in :host block with fallback values like --wy-component-title-color: #1C1917. Use these specific tokens in styles not generic semantic tokens. Follow Material Design 3 state layer patterns using ::before pseudo-elements with opacity transitions. Add focus-visible outlines 3px solid with 2px offset. Never use !important. Use semantic HTML. Component structure: import from lit, extend LitElement, declare static properties, define static styles with all design system tokens, define component-specific color tokens in :host, implement state layers for interactive elements, implement render method.\n\nPhase 4 Build and Prepare Testing. Build design system with npm run build, start dev server with npm run dev, create test page if needed importing tokens and component.\n\nPhase 5.1 Color Accuracy Testing MANDATORY. Create and run test-color-accuracy.py script. Extract reference colors from original using Playwright script that loads reference and extracts computed getComputedStyle values for all text backgrounds and borders converting to RGB tuples. Define REFERENCE_COLORS dictionary with element name to RGB tuple mapping like title: (28, 25, 23) for stone-900. Extract implementation colors using same method from component shadow root. Calculate color delta using Euclidean distance formula. For each color verify delta E is less than 2.0 which means imperceptible difference. Delta E between 2.0 and 5.0 is noticeable, above 5.0 is clearly visible. Print formatted table showing element, actual RGB, expected RGB, and delta value. Success criteria: ALL colors must have delta E less than 2.0. If test fails identify which colors have high delta, verify component uses correct component-specific tokens not generic semantic tokens, ensure tokens defined in :host block for Shadow DOM, re-run extraction to verify reference colors, update token values. Common failures: using var(--md-sys-color-on-surface) when reference uses Tailwind stone palette, tokens not cascading into Shadow DOM, circular variable references like --spacing-sm: var(--spacing-sm, ...), CDN cache serving old bundle.\n\nPhase 5.2 Interactive State Testing MANDATORY. Extract state colors from reference for hover focus active and disabled states using Playwright to hover elements, press Tab for focus, click for active. For each interactive element verify default rest state colors match reference exactly with delta E less than 2.0, hover state border background color changes match, focus state keyboard indicator matches with outline style color width and offset, active pressed state click appearance matches, disabled state opacity cursor and colors match if applicable, loading state indicators match if applicable, error state styling matches if applicable, and state transitions animation duration and easing match reference. Test all interactive states for buttons chips links form inputs. Success criteria: all state colors match reference with delta E less than 2.0, state transitions occur, no states missing, focus indicators meet WCAG. Common issues: using :hover without state layer pseudo-element, missing :focus-visible styles, hardcoding state colors instead of state layer opacity, missing disabled state, transitions too fast or slow.\n\nPhase 5.3 Pixel Perfect Visual Comparison MANDATORY. Use Playwright plus PIL to capture screenshots from reference and implementation at exact same viewport like 1200x900. Convert images to RGB numpy arrays. Calculate per-pixel difference using absolute value of array subtraction. Create diff heatmap where pixels within tolerance of 2 RGB points per channel are green and pixels outside tolerance are red. Calculate match percentage as matching pixels divided by total pixels times 100. Generate visual outputs: diff heatmap PNG with green for matching red for different, side-by-side comparison PNG with reference on left implementation on right with labels. Success criteria: match percentage must be 99.9% or higher allowing only 0.1% for anti-aliasing differences, no visible differences in side-by-side, diff heatmap shows only minor anti-aliasing if any. Acceptable differences: font rendering 1-2px due to browser OS, anti-aliasing on rounded corners within tolerance, sub-pixel rendering under 2 points per channel. Unacceptable: wrong colors different hue saturation lightness, wrong spacing margin padding gap offsets, wrong font sizes or weights, wrong border radius or shapes, missing elements or incorrect positioning. If match under 99.9%: review heatmap to identify problem areas, check if acceptable anti-aliasing or real issues, increase tolerance slightly if only anti-aliasing max 5, if real differences fix implementation and retest, never lower success threshold.\n\nPhase 5.4 Functional Testing. Verify all original functionality preserved, test modal open close, click handlers, navigation, keyboard shortcuts, event dispatching, state management. Run automated functional test or manual verification.\n\nPhase 5.5 Design System Compliance. Scan component code for hardcoded hex codes, magic number spacing, arbitrary durations, !important declarations. Verify 100% token usage. Zero hardcoded values allowed.\n\nPhase 6 Deliverables. Provide: 1 Color extraction report table showing reference RGB, hex value, design system token, whether exact match, and action taken. 2 Token mapping report complete table original value to token with status. 3 Color accuracy test results showing all delta E values under 2.0 with formatted table and max delta reported. 4 Interactive state test results showing all states verified with hover focus active disabled tested and screenshot evidence. 5 Pixel perfect comparison results with match percentage 99.9% or higher, diff heatmap image path, side-by-side comparison image path, and acceptable vs unacceptable differences documented. 6 Complete component code with full Web Component implementation, registration in src/main.js, component.json entry with props and examples, usage example in markup. 7 Design system updates if any showing new tokens added to tokens.css, dark mode variants, and rationale for why semantic tokens didn't work. 8 Integration instructions for using component, available API, event listeners, build and deploy commands.\n\nSuccess criteria ALL must pass: Color accuracy with all elements delta E under 2.0 imperceptible difference, pixel match with 99.9% or higher match percentage, all interactive states tested and verified matching reference, visual fidelity where component matches screenshot exactly, token usage 100% design tokens zero hardcoded values, Playwright tests all passing, dark mode works in both schemes, no console errors, semantic HTML, ARIA labels present, focus states visible and accessible.\n\nAnti-patterns to avoid: hardcoded colors hex rgb rgba, magic number spacing, arbitrary transitions, !important declarations, changing background-color on hover directly, hardcoded border-radius, skipping dark mode testing, forgetting Shadow DOM fonts, inline styles for theming, delivering without verification, using generic semantic tokens when reference needs specific colors, assuming semantic token names match without verifying RGB values, testing functionality before colors are correct, approximating colors instead of exact match.\n\nDesign system compliance for colors: use var(--md-sys-color-*) or var(--wy-*), provide dark mode variants, use color-mix() for transparency. Typography: use var(--font-serif) var(--font-sans) var(--font-display), clamp() for fluid scaling, design system letter spacing. Spacing: use var(--spacing-*) xxs through 3xl, follow 8px grid, clamp() for responsive. Shape: use var(--md-sys-shape-corner-*), corner-full for capsules. Motion: use var(--md-sys-motion-duration-*) and var(--md-sys-motion-easing-*), no magic durations. Interactive states: hover with ::before overlay, opacity var(--md-sys-state-hover-opacity), focus 3px outline 2px offset, never change background directly.\n\nExecute complete workflow with all testing phases 5.1 through 5.5 and provide all 8 deliverables with color extraction report, color accuracy delta E results, state testing results, pixel perfect comparison with heatmap and match percentage, complete code, design system updates, and integration instructions.",
