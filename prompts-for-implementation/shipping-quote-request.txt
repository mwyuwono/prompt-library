Please draft an email for requesting shipping quotes from multiple vendors. The letter should provide details for the item(s) I am considering purchasing, which I have included above.

Also provide the delivery address (above) so that the vendor can accurately calculate shipping prices.

The letter should ask for information on shipping cost and delivery timeframe.

The letter should include a link to the listing, which I have provided above. This enables the shipping vendor to view images of the item.

The tone of the letter should be clear, and straightforward. Be very concise. For example "Hello, Could you please assist me with a shipping quote for them item below, which I plan to purchase from [Auction house name] in [City, State]?"
