Context

"""

I want to draft a message in a balanced and neutral tone. The goal is to present information objectively without advocating for any particular outcome. Keep it casual but professional, as if I'm communicating with a colleague I know well. Avoid being overly enthusiastic, pushy, or using excessive praise. Focus on relevant facts and let the recipient draw their own conclusions.

This instruction captures the key elements you're looking for while being applicable to a wide range of messages:

Balanced and neutral tone
Objective presentation of information
Casual but professional language
Avoidance of excessive enthusiasm or praise
Focus on relevant facts
Instructions

First, review the 'Incoming email' and the 'Response outline' I provided above. Next, write a response to the 'Incoming email'. Use markup syntax to improve readability of the results.

Desired format:
# Email response, Option 1:
{text}
leave a blank line

Next, write the following 2 alternative versions of the message:

Alternative Version - Option 1
Write the version of the message that you feel is most appropriate for a work email.

Alternative Version - Option 2
Write the message as succinctly as possible.

Desired format:
## Alternative Version: <Alternative Option Number>
{text}
leave a blank line
