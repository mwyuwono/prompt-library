The Connoisseur’s Decalogue: A 10-Point Evaluation Scale
The Baseline (0–2)
Score 0: The Non-Entry. Modern reproductions, CNC-machined "revival" pieces, or objects less than a century old. Even if high quality, they lack the historical soul required for this scale.

Score 1: The Fragment. A genuine period piece that has suffered catastrophic loss—perhaps a chest of drawers converted into a vanity, or a chair with all legs replaced. It is "authentic" in material but "dead" in form.

Score 2: The Honest Antique. A standard, 100+ year old object (e.g., late Victorian/Edwardian). It is genuine but mass-produced using industrial circular saws and uniform thicknessing. It represents the "as-found" baseline for the general market.

The Industrial/Transition Gap (3–5)
Score 3: The Workhorse. A mid-to-late 19th-century piece showing early machine intervention. It has honest wear but lacks the idiosyncratic charm of earlier hand-work.

Score 4: The Refurbished Period Piece. A pre-1830 object that has been "over-restored." The original surface has been stripped, or it has been "dipped and stripped," killing the patina. It is a period carcass with a modern soul.

Score 5: The Marrying. A pre-industrial piece where two period elements have been joined (e.g., a 1750s top on a 1780s base). Both parts are "right," but they didn’t start life together.

The Pre-Industrial Threshold (6–10)
Entry into this tier requires evidence of pre-1830 manufacture: hand-cut dovetails, pit-saw marks, and hand-planed secondary woods.

Score 6: The Good Period Piece
The entry point for true connoisseurship. The object is pre-industrial and aesthetically pleasing. It shows clear "hand-of-the-maker" evidence (e.g., irregular drawer bottoms).

Condition: May have replaced brasses or minor repairs to the feet.

The Look: It looks its age, but the finish is likely a 20th-century "refresh."

Score 7: The Distinguished Example
A piece that exhibits superior design for its region. It moves beyond the "country" vernacular into a more sophisticated "city" aesthetic.

Condition: Significant original components (90%+). Any repairs are professional and non-invasive.

The Look: Notable development in the carving or joinery that suggests a master’s hand.

Score 8: The Collector’s Choice (The Holy Trinity: Tier 1)
At this level, we see the convergence of Rarity of Form and Structural Integrity.

The Surface: The object retains an old, deep finish—perhaps not the "first," but one that has been on the piece for over a century, creating a rich, "alligator" texture.

The Form: An unusual variant (e.g., a kettle-base desk or a rare highboy).

Integrity: No "married" parts; the secondary woods (pine, poplar, oak) are original and show the expected oxidation.

Score 9: The Exceptional Survival
A "9" is characterized by Purity of Surface. It is an object that has spent its life in a darkened parlor or a dry attic, escaping the "cleaning" trends of the 1920s.

The Surface: "In the grease." This is the untouched, original 18th-century finish, darkened by 200 years of oxidation and wax.

Integrity: Original hardware (brasses) in their original boring holes. No "ghost" marks from previous handles.

The Hand: Tool marks are vibrant and crisp, not softened by centuries of over-polishing.

Score 10: The Museum Masterpiece
The pinnacle of the decorative arts. A "10" is an object where provenance, artistry, and condition reach a perfect state.

Rarity: A form so rare it may be one of only a handful known (e.g., a signed Townsend or Goddard piece).

Surface: "Pristine original." The finish is exactly as it left the workshop, simply aged. It has never been "restored," only conserved.

Documentation: Often accompanied by original bills of sale or clear descent through a single family.

The X-Factor: It possesses "presence"—a sculptural quality where the proportions are mathematically perfect and the wood choice (flame mahogany, tiger maple) is superlative.

Appraiser's Note: When moving from a 6 to a 10, remember that we are no longer buying "furniture." We are buying time captured in amber. A '6' is a beautiful chair to sit in; a '10' is a sculpture that happens to be a chair.
